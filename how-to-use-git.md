# How to use `git`

1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add <file_or_directory>`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m "<message>"`
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout <branch_or_commit>`
6. Create new branches with `git switch <branch_name>`
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
